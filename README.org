#+TITLE: Elegoo Neptune Profiles for PrusaSlicer/slic3r/SuperSlicer
[[file:Elegoo/NEPTUNE2_thumbnail.png]]

This is a simple adaptation of the Creality Ender profiles for the Elegoo Neptune family (1, 2, 2S, 2D, X, and the 3).

Copy to your machine, then they will be available in PrusaSlicer as presets with nice thumbnail images.

Thanks to [[https://github.com/just-trey/][just_trey]] for the platform texture and for turning Elegoo's cad files into a nice stl.

** Installation

1. Close PrusaSlicer.
2. Copy =Elegoo.ini=, =Elegoo.idx=, and the =Elegoo= directory to your PrusaSlicer vendor directory. On MacOS this will be in =~/Library/Application\ Support/PrusaSlicer/vendor=, on Windows this will be =C:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer\vendor=. AppData is a hidden folder.
3. Open PrusaSlicer and add printers (Gear icon -> Add/Remove Presets -> Other Vendors -> Check Elegoo -> Click Elegoo FFF -> Click checkbox -> Filaments -> Finish).

** Modifications/Notes

- Configured printable area is 225mm x 210mm. This is to avoid the binder clips that come stock. If you've fitted a magnetic sheet without binder clips, you can increase the configured area to 235mm x 235mm.
- All filament temperatures and settings are the same as the Creality Ender 3.
- Neptune 2D (dual extruder) profile is based on Creality CR-X profile and modified by [[https://github.com/mlee12382/][mlee12382]].
