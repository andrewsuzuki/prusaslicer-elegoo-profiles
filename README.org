#+TITLE: Elegoo Neptune Profiles for PrusaSlicer/slic3r/SuperSlicer
[[file:Elegoo/NEPTUNE2_thumbnail.png]]

This is a simple adaptation of the Creality Ender profiles for the Elegoo Neptune family (2/2S and 2D and also for the X and the 3).

Copy to your machine, then they will be available in PrusaSlicer as presets with nice thumbnail images.

Thanks to just_trey for the platform texture and for turning Elegoo's cad files into a nice stl.

** Installation

1. Close PrusaSlicer.
2. Copy =Elegoo.ini=, =Elegoo.idx=, and the =Elegoo= directory to your PrusaSlicer vendor directory. On MacOS this will be in =~/Library/Application\ Support/PrusaSlicer/vendor=, on Windows this will be =C:\users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\PrusaSlicer\vendor=.
3. Download just_trey's neptune 2 print model and platform texture from [[https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/91525-elegoo-neptune-2-print-model-and-platform-texture][here]].
4. Rename stl to =neptune2_bed.stl= and svg to =neptune2.svg=.
5. Copy stl and svg to the Elegoo vendor directory.
6. Open PrusaSlicer and add printers (Gear icon -> Add/Remove Presets -> Other Vendors -> Check Elegoo -> Click Elegoo FFF -> Click checkbox -> Filaments -> Finish).

** Modifications/Notes

- Configured printable area is 225mm x 210mm. This is to avoid the binder clips that come stock. If you've fitted a magnetic sheet without binder clips, you can increase the configured area to 235mm x 235mm.
- All filament temperatures and settings are the same as the Creality Ender 3.
- Neptune 2D (dual extruder) profile is based on Creality CR-X profile and modified by mlee12382.
